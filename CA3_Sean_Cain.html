It provides a means to describe the structure of text-based information in a document - by denoting certain texts as links, headings, paragraphs, lists and so on - and to supplement that text with interactive forms, embedded images, and other objects., HTML is written in the form of tags, surrounded by angle brackets. HTML can also describe, to some degree, the appearance and semantics of a document, and can include embedded scripting language code (such as JavaScript) which can affect the behavious of Web browders and other HTML processors.</p>
